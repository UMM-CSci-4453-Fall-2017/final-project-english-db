# What
A system keeping track of books nominated for an award.

**Summary of the project:** The goal of this project is to create a user interface that allows user to enter book data which is stored in our database. The books are all nominated either on the long or short list for the Booker Prize which is comprised of books authored in the English language and published in the UK. The end goal is to allow the user to view and compare various aspects of the nominated books and allow them to visually represent these aspects in a series of graphs and statistical tools. The books range in age starting from about 1970 to the present.
